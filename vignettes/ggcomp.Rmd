(This vignette is currently largely aspirational. It describes ggcomp as it will be when complete.)

The ggcomp package does three things:

* Converts large datasets into smaller summaries.
* Provides a standard way of representing geometric primitives.
* Manipulated geometric primitives.

Compared to ggplot2, ggcomp covers similar functionality to the `stat_` and `position_` functions. But each function in ggcomp tends to be simpler, and there's a standard data representation that makes richer composition easier. Additionally, the majority of functions in ggcomp have been written in C++, allowing you to work with much larger datasets.

## Statistical summaries

ggcomp provides six functions designed to work with smaller (<1e6 obs) datasets:

* `compute_density()`
* `compute_density_2d()`
* `compute_smooth()`
* `compute_model()`
* `compute_ecdf()`
* `compute_qq()`

And two flexible functions designed to be used with larger datasets:

* `compute_bin()`
* `compute_summary()`

These functions have a consistent interface:

* The first argument is `data`, and that object is used for method dispatch. 
  All functions currently implemented provide methods for data frames and
  `grouped_df`s from dplyr. In the future we will add summaries for other 
  types of object.

* The subsequent arguments either refer to variables (as formulas) or 
  specify parameters of the transformation. `compute_*` functions never do
  NSE.

* The result the transformation is always a data frame. The variables should
  be consistent (i.e. always use the same names) and be "type-stable".
  The result should always has the same columns with consistent types.
  All result columns should end with `_` - this avoids conflicts with variables
  carried through the grouping process.

These properties make the summaries easy to program with, at the slight expense of more typing when using interactively. This is a good trade-off because most people will use these functions through a ggvis `layer` function.

Typically each `compute_x()` function will also be accompanied by a `compute_x_vec()` function. This will usually be implemented in C++, and works with vectors, rather than data frames. Summaries that require non-trivial computation to determine parameters should separate these out into their own function, `param_x()`. This makes it easier to test, and to consistently pick parameters across groups.

### Missing values

All summary functions should have an `na.rm` argument which defaults to FALSE.

* `FALSE`: Where possible, preserves missing values in output. If not possible 
  to preserve, needs to print warning message describing how many missing
  values were removed.

* `TRUE`: silently drop missing values.

### Variable types

* Continuous: integer, numeric, POSIXct, Date, difftime.
* Categorical: factor, ordered factor

See `restore()` for a convenient approach to solving this problem.

## Geometric primitives

There are only three fundamental geometric primitives needed to draw any graphic:

* points & text: $(x, y)$
* paths & polygons: ${(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)}$

There are three additional primitives that could be drawn using polygons but have additional behaviour that makes polygons a poor fit: (polygons are extremely generate, which limits the types of transformation we can do with them).

* arcs: $([x, y, [r_1, r_2], [\theta_1, \theta_2]])$
* rects (and images): $([x_1, x_2], [y_1, y_2])$
* ribbons: an ordered sequence of intervals: 
  ${(x_{1}, [y_{11}, y_{12}]), ..., (x_n, [y_{n1}, y_{n2}])}$, 
  where $x_i < x_{i+1}$

ggcomp uses a standard parameterisation for these geometries. They are always represented as a data frame:

* points, text: `x_` and `y_`, each row represents a point.
* paths, polygons: `x_` and `y_`, each group represents a path/polygon.
* rects: `x1_`, `x2_`, `y1_`, `y2_`.
* ribbons: `x_`, `y1_`, `y2_`.
* arcs: `x_`, `y_`, `r1_`, `r2_`, `theta1_`, `theta2_`.

For each geometric object, ggcomp provides a function that generates this representation: `render_point()`, `render_path()`, `render_polygon()`, etc. These functions create an object of class of (e.g.) `c("geometry", "geometry_point", "data.frame")`.

Many of the geoms provided by ggplot2 are a reparameterisation of these primitives:

  * Path:
  
    * segment: a path parameterised by four coordinates
    * line: a path with ordered x
    * step: a line with additional points
    * spoke: a segment specified by a loation, radius and angle
    * function: a line specified by a function
  
  * Rect
  
    * interval: a degenerate rect with zero width in one direction
    * bar: a rect specified by a location and a width
    * tile: a rect specified by a location, height and width

  * Ribbon
  
    * area: a ribbon with `y1 = 0`.

  * Polygon:
  
    * ellipse: a polygon specified by a center, two radiuses and an angle

The parameterisation of the primitives (in terms of locations, not dimensions), is always to be preferred because they're easier to transform.

There are a also a handful of geoms that are combinations of primitives:

* boxplot: two intervals (hinge & whiskers), one point (median) and 
  a set of points (the outliers).
* smooth: line (estimate) + ribbon (standard errors).

## Geometric transformations

* All
    * `geometry_flip()` (except ribbons).
    * `geometry_reflect(dir = "x")`
  
  * Paths/polygons
    * `geometry_interpolate()`
    * `geometry_transform()` (would use [adaptive resampling](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/example/))
    * `geometry_simplify()`
    * `geometry_jitter()`
  
  * Lines
    * `geometry_step()` 
    * `geometry_stack(axis = c("x", "y"))` (converts to ribbons)
    * `geometry_rescale()`
  
  * Points
    * `geometry_jitter()`
    * `geometry_stack(axis = c("x", "y"))` (converts to rects)
